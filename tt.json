the amount of volcanic activity. While hydrothermal SMS are more frequent at fast-spreading MOR, the largest deposits occur where volcanism appears to be a minimum. Here, at so-called amagmatic segments on slow- and ultra-slow spreading ridges, ultramafic rocks from the lower-crust and upper-mantle are exhumed by long-lived faulting; a process that is thought to affect 50% of the length of slow-spreading ridges. Ultramafic-hosted seafloor massive sulphides (muSMS) in these settings form some of the largest deposits known, hosting high metal concentrations of Au, Cu, Ni, E-tech elements (Co, Pt). Whereas the magmatic driving force for volcanic-hosted SMS deposits is well established, it remains contentious for the muSMS. Similarly, while there are models for
the sub-surface structure and extent of volcanic-hosted SMS, little is known about muSMS. For some muSMS, vent fluid chemistry indicates the potential for extensive sub-seafloor metal precipitation, possibly by interaction with pH barriers due to serpentinisation of the host rock. Furthermore, the physical, chemical and microbial mechanisms affecting muSMS after their formation are poorly constrained. \n\nOur study aims to test the hypothesis that muSMS deposits form extensive sub-surface mineralisation and undergo significant post-formational modification at and beneath the seafloor under the influence of highly variable pH conditions as a result of interaction with ultramafic rocks and during serpentinisation. \n\nOur plan is to combine novel geophysical techniques (electromagnetic induction and inverted down-hole seismic tomography) with surface mapping and sub-seafloor drilling (recovering host rocks, sulphides, sediment and fluids) to image
the 3D structure and composition of the deposit and its surroundings. The mineralogy, geochemistry and isotope signatures of the samples will reveal the paragenetic history of the deposits including formation, recrystallisation, metal mobilisation, alteration and penetration by seawater. Hydrothermal fluid samples will reveal the nature of the heat source driving deposit formation
and host-rock interactions and, combined with studies of metalliferous sediment, constrain metal mobility during later alteration. Ages of these processes will be constrained by radiometric dating. Rates of processes will be constrained by in situ and lab-based, abiotic oxidation and microbial alteration experiments. We will draw these observations together using thermo-physio-chemical numerical modelling to construct a coherent understanding of the formation and preservation of these large polymetallic muSMS deposits in todays-oceans. Our approach requires two cruises
to the largest known and best characterised muSMS field at 13degrees30minutesN, Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Despite being technically ambitious, our experience from the EU-funded Blue Mining project and the involvement of both academic and industrial partners, contributing in-kind data and costs, significantly de-risks the research.", "linkout": "http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/5EEE2811-0C75-4C24-A62C-5751AA2D791E", "researchers": [{"id": "ur.01145333060.27", "last_name": "Murton", "orcid_id":

Infantile beriberi rates peak at 3 months of age, when breast milk is the only source of infant nutrition. In Cambodia, a heavy reliance on white rice means that women consume a thiamine-poor diet, so women produce breast milk low in thiamine, putting their breastfed infants at risk of deficiency and infantile beriberi. We need to focus efforts to improve women's thiamine
intake during the perinatal period to optimize health outcomes of their infants. Research has shown maternal thiamine supplementation is effective in raising thiamine status and reducing the incidence of infantile beriberi in regions where thiamine deficiency is prevalent, but trial data is limited and the lowest effective dose of supplementation has never been established. Therefore, my proposed research is a 22-week double-blind, four-parallel arm, placebo-controlled randomized trial of thiamine supplementation to assess human milk total thiamine concentration at 24 weeks postpartum. The objective of this study is to estimate the dose on the dose response curve where additional maternal intake of thiamine (oral dose) no longer meaningfully increases human
milk total thiamine concentration at 24 weeks postpartum. Women will be randomized to one of four treatment arms, and will be asked to consume one oral capsule daily. We will collect breast milk at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks postnatal, to assess thiamine concentrations. Results from this study may inform future public health fortification interventions, that may be implemented in Cambodia and other at-risk countries to increase maternal thiamine intake, and prevent infantile beriberi and related mortality.", "funding_org_city": "Ottawa", "RCDC": [{"id": "547", "name": "Pediatric"}, {"id": "430", "name": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine"}, {"id": "507",

of the most
prevalent, chronic health conditions worldwide. In addition to age-related hearing impairment, excessive noise exposure is a leading cause of hearing loss. Beyond the devastating effects of hearing impairment itself, there is epidemiological evidence linking hearing loss to an increased risk for dementia, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). At present, however, we lack a full
understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for the relationship between hearing loss and dementia, which has hindered our ability to intervene effectively. Although neuroinflammation, as evidenced by activated microglia, has been identified as a key pathological correlate of both noise-induced hearing loss and age-related cognitive decline, its role as a common mechanistic link between hearing loss and dementia has not been elucidated. To that end, we will noise expose young adult male and female wildtype (Aim 1) and transgenic rats that represent a model for
prodromal AD (Aim 2), and use a novel combination of (1) PET/MRI scans for neuroinflammation, (2) blood biomarker assays of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines, (3) cognitive behavioural testing,
and finally (4) post-mortem neurohistological analyses of microglial activation and AD-related pathology. By correlating these complementary results from the same rats, we will gain crucial insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying how hearing loss alters cognition throughout aging, and affects the susceptibility to AD-related pathology. Furthermore, our innovative proposal will establish a preclinical model capable of capturing the earliest interactions between hearing loss and dementia; a translational platform which could further inform future clinical investigations.", "RCDC": [{"id": "298", "name": "Alzheimer's Disease"}, {"id": "542", "name": "Neurodegenerative"}, {"id": "501", "name": "Brain Disorders"}, {"id": "295", "name": "Aging"}, {"id": "493", "name": "Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD)"}, {"id": "387", "name": "Neurosciences"}, {"id": "514", "name": "Dementia"}, {"id": "487", "name":

A significant portion of this risk may be due to variation in the types of bacteria in the female genital tract (FGT), collectively known as the vaginal microbiome.  The types of bacteria that colonize the vagina differ between women, and the vaginal microbiome composition has been linked to reproductive health outcomes including HIV acquisition after a sexual exposure. High diversity of bacterial species in the vaginal microbiome may lead to a condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV). Although BV is often asymptomatic, it has been linked to increased HIV susceptibility, and unfortunately is more common in ACB women. Antibiotic treatment of BV can reverse these changes in the short term, but BV usually recurs within a few months. In addition, my supervisor's research group has found that antibiotic treatment actually increased some immune indicators of HIV risk.  The proposed research aims to test novel microbiome-focused clinical strategies, both antibiotic- and probiotic-based, to reduce HIV susceptibility among ACB women. I hypothesize that standard antibiotic treatment for BV will increase certain immune indicators of HIV susceptibility and recruit HIV target cells to the vaginal lining, but that addition of a novel probiotic will restore the vaginal microbiome to a

Novel antitumor strategies are needed for the cancer cure. CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) are white blood cells that protect against pathogens and cancer. Despite the fact that these white blood cells exist in cancer patients, the immune system becomes tolerant to tumors. In the tumor microenvironment, CTLs are killed or weakened by tumor-derived regulatory T cells. Our lab has recently discovered how a cytotoxic protein (granzyme-B) secreted by regulatory T cells kills CTLs. Furthermore, we identified that treatment of CTLs with a cell growth factor (cytokine IL-7) or a drug (rapamycin) prevented expression of mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) that uptake cytotoxic protein (granzyme-B), on T-cell surfaces and thereby these CTLs became resistant to regulatory T cell-mediated killing in tumor microenvironment, resulting in an enhanced tumor control. The proposed project will systematically identify cytokine IL-7 stimulated signals, cellular proteins, and the changes that are required at metabolic and DNA levels to enhance antitumor immunity. This information is critical for developing an effective T-cell immunotherapy against cancer to circumvent the problem of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Successful implementation of the proposed research will represent an important step in making scientific discoveries and helping to develop immunotherapeutic strategies against cancer. Overall, this project will contribute to the antitumor strategies aimed at developing an effective T-cell immunotherapy for cancer; using patients own white blood cells, thus reducing healthcare costs and patient sufferings.", "RCDC": [{"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "531", "name": "Immunization"}, {"id": "583", "name": "Vaccine Related"}], "category_rcdc": [{"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "531", "name": "Immunization"}, {"id": "583", "name": "Vaccine Related"}], "category_bra": [{"id": "4000", "name": "Basic Science"}], "category_hrcs_rac": [{"id": "10502", "name": "5.2 Cellular and gene therapies"}, {"id": "10201", "name": "2.1 Biological and endogenous factors"}], "HRCS_RAC": [{"id": "10502", "name": "5.2 Cellular and gene therapies"}, {"id": "10201", "name": "2.1 Biological and endogenous factors"}], "funding_org_acronym": "SHRF", "funding_org_name": "Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation", "concepts": ["metabolic", "cytotoxic proteins", "cell immunotherapy", "uptake", "healthcare costs", "cell growth factor", "cells", "CTL", "novel antitumor strategy", "lab", "successful implementation", "signal", "immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment", "expression", "antitumor strategies", "research", "new cases", "patient suffering", "antitumor immunity", "granzymes", "cancer", "Saskatchewan", "enhanced tumor control", "mTORC1-KIF13A-M6PR Axis", "white blood cells", "cell surface", "changes", "M6PR", "rapamycin", "immunotherapeutic strategies", "mannose-6-phosphate receptor", "cancer cure", "cell fate", "Canadian Cancer Society", "cancer patients", "treatment", "pathogens", "tumor", "own white blood cells", "DNA level", "enhance immunity", "cytokine IL-7", "immune system", "tumor microenvironment", "scientific discovery", "drugs", "information", "important step", "patients", "CD8+ cytotoxic T", "fact", "problem", "people", "project", "cellular proteins"], "terms": ["metabolic", "cytotoxic proteins", "cell immunotherapy", "uptake", "healthcare costs", "cell growth factor", "cells", "CTL", "novel antitumor strategy", "lab", "successful implementation", "signal", "immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment", "expression", "antitumor strategies", "research", "new cases", "patient suffering", "antitumor immunity", "granzymes", "cancer", "Saskatchewan", "enhanced tumor control", "mTORC1-KIF13A-M6PR Axis", "white blood cells", "cell surface", "changes", "M6PR", "rapamycin", "immunotherapeutic strategies", "mannose-6-phosphate receptor", "cancer cure", "cell fate", "Canadian Cancer Society", "cancer patients", "treatment", "pathogens", "tumor", "own white blood cells", "DNA level", "enhance immunity", "cytokine IL-7", "immune system", "tumor microenvironment", "scientific discovery", "drugs", "information", "important step", "patients", "CD8+ cytotoxic T", "fact", "problem", "people", "project", "cellular proteins"], "funding_chf": 73727.0, "title_language": "en", "research_org_cities": [{"id": 6141256, "name": "Saskatoon"}, {"id": 6141256, "name": "Saskatoon"}], "original_title": "Regulating T-cell Fate by Targeting mTORC1-KIF13A-M6PR Axis to Enhance Immunity against Cancer", "end_date": "2021-12-31", "researcher_details": [{"first_name": "Anjuman", "id": null, "middle_name": null, "last_name": "Ara", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25152.31", "country": "CA", "state": "Saskatchewan", "name": "University of Saskatchewan", "city_id": "6141256", "country_code": "CA", "city": null, "state_code": "CA-SK"}], "role": "PI"}, {"first_name": "Jim", "id": null, "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Xiang", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25152.31", "country": "CA", "state": "Saskatchewan", "name": "University of Saskatchewan", "city_id": "6141256", "country_code": "CA", "city": null, "state_code": "CA-SK"}], "role": "Co-PI"}], "investigator_details": [{"first_name": "Anjuman", "id": null, "middle_name": null, "last_name": "Ara", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25152.31", "country": "CA", "state": "Saskatchewan", "name": "University of Saskatchewan", "city_id": "6141256", "country_code": "CA", "city": null, "state_code": "CA-SK"}], "role": "PI"}, {"first_name": "Jim", "id": null, "middle_name": "", "last_name": "Xiang", "affiliations": [{"id": "grid.25152.31", "country": "CA", "state": "Saskatchewan", "name": "University of Saskatchewan", "city_id": "6141256", "country_code": "CA", "city": null, "state_code": "CA-SK"}], "role": "Co-PI"}], "funding_currency": "CAD", "research_org_countries": [{"id": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"id": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "funding_aud": 104952.0, "HRCS_HC": [{"id": "911", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "903", "name": "Inflammatory and Immune System"}], "category_hrcs_hc": [{"id": "911", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "903", "name": "Inflammatory and Immune System"}], "funding_cad": 100000.0, "research_org_state_codes": [{"id": "CA-SK", "name": "Saskatchewan"}, {"id": "CA-SK", "name": "Saskatchewan"}], "funding_jpy": 8130592.0, "title": "Regulating T-cell

With this proposal, I hypothesise that glacier surfaces represent important intermediates between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, driving evolution of unique adaptations in ice algal lineages that represent exaptations of ancestral Streptophytes for the colonisation of land. To test my hypothesis, I will unite the disciplines of genomics, engineering, glaciology and biology to constrain ice algal cold-adaptation mechanisms to life in surface ice and provide unique insight into the aspects of Streptophyte biology that enabled the conquest of land. I will achieve this by i) sequencing the genomes of two ice environment specialists that dominate across the cryosphere, allowing identification of ice algal cold-adaptation mechanisms and homologs in extant basal land plant lineages; ii) develop a controlled environment microalgal assessment system, i.e. \u2018photosynthetron\u2019, optimised for deployment in surface ice environments in collaboration with a leading developer of high-throughput plant and algal phenotyping platforms; iii) deploy this across the cryosphere to validate cold-adaptation mechanisms identified from genome interrogation and significantly advance our understanding of how life excels within icy environments.

risk of fracture. However, it is unclear what intensity of exercise people with osteoporosis or low bone mass can handle due to safety concerns.

It will drive progress toward practical quantum computers and usher in the era where they will have revolutionary impact on real-world challenges in a range of multidisciplinary themes including discovery of novel drugs and new materials, through to quantum-enhanced machine learning, information security and even carbon reduction through optimised resource usage.\nThe Hub will bring together
leading quantum research teams across 17 universities, into a collaboration with more than 25 national and international commercial, governmental and academic entities. It will address critical research challenges, and work with partners to accelerate the development of quantum computing in the UK. It will foster a generation of UK-based scientists and engineers equipped with the new skill sets needed to make the UK into a global centre for innovation as the quantum sector emerges. The Hub will engage with government and citizens so that there is a wide appreciation of
the potential of this transformative technology, and a broad understanding of the issues in its adoption.\nHub research will focus on the hardware and software that will be needed for future quantum computers and simulators. In hardware we will advance a range of different platforms, encompassing simulation, near term quantum computers, and longer term fully scalable machines. In software the Hub will develop fundamental techniques, algorithms, new applications and means to verify the correct operation of any future machine. Hardware and software research will be closely integrated in order to provide a full-stack capability for future machines, enabled by the broad expertise of our partners. We will also study the architecture of these machines, and develop emulation techniques to accelerate their development. \nSuccess will require close engagement with a wide range of commercial and government organisations. Our initial partners include finance (OSI), suppliers (Gooch & Housego, Oxford Instruments, E6), integrators and developers (OQC, QM, CQC, QxBranch, D-Wave), users from industry (Rolls-Royce, Johnson Matthey, GSK, BT, BP, TrakM8, Airbus, QinetiQ) and government (DSTL, NCSC), and other research institutions (NPL, ATI, Heilbronn, Fraunhofer). We will build on this strong network using Industry Days, Hackathons and targeted workshops, authoritative reports, and collaborative projects funded through the Hub and partners. Communications and engagement with the community through a range of outreach events across the partnership will inform wider society of the potential for quantum computing, and we will interact with policy makers within government to ensure that the potential benefits to the UK can be realised.\nThe Hub will train researchers and PhD students in a wide range of skills, including entrepreneurship, intellectual property and commercialisation. This will help deliver the
skilled workforce that will be required for the emerging quantum economy. We will work with our partners to deliver specific training for industry, targeting technical, commercial and executive audiences, to ensure the results of the Hub and their commercial and scientific opportunities are understood.\nThe Hub will deliver demonstrations, new algorithms and techniques, spinout technologies, and contribute to a skilled workforce. It will also engage with potential users, the forthcoming National Centre for Quantum Computing, the global QC community, policy makers and the wider public to ensure the UK is a leader in this transformative new capability.", "category_hrcs_rac": [{"id": "10105", "name": "1.5 Resources and infrastructure (underpinning)"}], "HRCS_RAC": [{"id": "10105", "name": "1.5 Resources and

by
cancer; this rate is on the rise in Canada, especially in First Nations populations. Cancer treatments save lives but can also cause infertility in ~20% of survivors. Pre-treatment freezing of semen samples is not an option for pre-adolescent boys; instead, small biopsies of testis tissue can be frozen as a source for future restoration of fertility using emerging reproductive technologies. However, currently the only safe strategy for producing sperm from immature testis biopsies is culturing in vitro, which has only been achieved in mice, not in any non-rodent species. My proposed supervisor (Dr. Honaramooz) is at the forefront of this research area and is a pioneer in developing innovative reproductive technologies using animal models. The objective of this proposal is to use novel approaches to induce testis maturation with an ultimate goal of sperm production in vitro using neonatal piglet testis biopsies as a model for restoration of fertility potential of cancer survivors. We will use three-dimensional culture systems to allow the growth of testis explants as intact tissues. As an innovative alternative, we will also culture testis cells to increase their numbers before shaping them into artificial testis organoids using state-of-the-art tissue engineering technologies. Our plans are unique and important because we
use innovative approaches to find a way to produce sperm in vitro using a non-rodent species model for future applications using human samples. Therefore, this novel and exciting research has
tremendous potential applications in restoring the fertility of cancer survivors.", "RCDC": [{"id": "547", "name": "Pediatric"}, {"id": "409", "name": "Infertility"}, {"id": "379", "name": "Regenerative Medicine"}, {"id": "416", "name": "Contraception/Reproduction"}, {"id": "580", "name": "Urologic Diseases"}, {"id": "338", "name": "Biotechnology"}, {"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "337", "name": "Bioengineering"}], "category_rcdc": [{"id": "547", "name": "Pediatric"}, {"id": "409", "name": "Infertility"}, {"id": "379", "name": "Regenerative Medicine"}, {"id": "416", "name": "Contraception/Reproduction"}, {"id": "580", "name": "Urologic Diseases"}, {"id": "338", "name": "Biotechnology"}, {"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "337", "name": "Bioengineering"}], "category_bra": [{"id": "4000", "name": "Basic Science"}], "funding_org_acronym": "SHRF", "funding_org_name": "Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation", "concepts": ["infertility",

Often these challenges are a result of harsh or critical feedback and evaluation. One unique challenge that women athletes face, related to body, eating, and exercise attitudes and behaviours, is the Female Athlete Triad (the Triad). The Triad is a medical diagnosis that includes assessment of daily caloric needs, reproductive and bone health. However, research has focused heavily on some elements of the Triad, such as reproductive and bone health, without consideration of the psychosocial related factors. Additionally, previous research has examined elite athletes while neglecting recreational level participants. Because of the current imbalance in the existing research the goal of the proposed study is to seek to holistically explore and examine the Triad and its' impact on womens' health and well-being within their sport experiences. The proposed study has the potential to expand our understanding of the Triad and approach the health and well-being challenges from a holistic prospective.

widely held perception that RAS is 'undruggable'.

However, the trauma of undergoing surgery invariably leads to a weakened immune system which contributes to the likelihood of the tumour reappearing and spreading throughout the patient's body. Natural killer (NK) cells, as their name suggests, are proficient at surveying the body and destroying any cancer cells that appear before they
can develop into solid tumours. Although the importance of NK cells in controlling tumour growth is well recognized, my research has shown that surgery dramatically impairs their ability to recognize and respond to tumour cells. Unfortunately, there is no current strategy for addressing the suppression in NK cell activity which occurs following surgery and new approaches targeting
this critical stage may hold the potential for improving patient outcomes. We have recently shown that following surgery a large number highly immune suppressive cells are released from the bone marrow and that strategies that prevent their interaction with NK cells can have beneficial effects in animal models. Therefore, we believe that targeting these myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in patients may provide an effective approach for reversing the immune suppressive effects of surgery. To accomplish this goal we have attempted to identify ways of targeting the
MDSC population that arises following surgery.

Innate immunity is the first line of the host defense system that detects and defenses against virus infection. IAV infection is detected largely by an intracellular sensor, a protein called retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I). RIG-I has long been thought to be exclusively cytoplasmic. Interestingly, IAV represents few of the RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus. How does a cytoplasmic sensor recognize a nuclear replicating virus has
been puzzling the field. We recently showed that RIG-I, in addition to being in the cytoplasm, also resides in the nucleus and is critical to mount innate response to IAV infection. The current project will characterize RIG-I interactions with IAV. We propose three aims: to characterize the signaling cascades arising from nuclear RIG-I; to characterize how the aberrant viral RNA generated during IAV infection are recognized by cytoplasmic and nuclear RIG-I; and to examine the role of nuclear RIG-I functions in response to IAV infection in mice.

This is due to patients not presenting with symptoms of pancreatic cancer until advanced stages of the disease. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer do not have a family history, and a significant risk factor is inflammation developing from recurrent forms of pancreatitis. These findings suggest events that promote pancreatic
cancer are environmental in nature. My laboratory uses animal models to understand the events shared by recurrent pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and determine which cellular pathways are
altered by these adverse environmental conditions. We are currently examining a protein known as ATF3, which is expressed under conditions of tissue injury and inflammation. We have shown ATF3 functions to promote progression of injury in pancreatitis and suggests it provides a link to pancreatic cancer. We will use novel preclinical models and global sequencing approaches to not only understand how ATF3 functions, but to identify the molecular complexes that ATF3 works with to promote pancreatic injury and cancer progression. By doing so, we will identify novel factors that can be targeted both as diagnostics and therapeutics in patients that carry a high risk for developing pancreatic cancer.", "funding_org_city": "Ottawa", "RCDC": [{"id": "411", "name": "Pancreatic Cancer"}, {"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "559", "name": "Rare Diseases"}, {"id": "344", "name": "Digestive Diseases"}, {"id": "543", "name": "Orphan Drug"}], "category_rcdc": [{"id": "411", "name": "Pancreatic Cancer"}, {"id": "503", "name": "Cancer"}, {"id": "559", "name": "Rare Diseases"}, {"id": "344", "name": "Digestive Diseases"}, {"id": "543", "name": "Orphan Drug"}], "category_bra": [{"id": "4000", "name": "Basic Science"}], "category_hrcs_rac": [{"id": "10401", "name": "4.1 Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies"}, {"id": "10201", "name": "2.1 Biological and endogenous factors"}], "HRCS_RAC": [{"id": "10401", "name": "4.1 Discovery and preclinical testing of markers and technologies"}, {"id": "10201", "name": "2.1 Biological and endogenous factors"}], "funding_org_acronym": "CIHR", "funding_org_name": "Canadian Institutes of Health Research", "concepts": ["events", "death", "ATF3 functions", "pancreatitis", "diagnostics", "progression", "link", "therapeutics", "pancreatic cancer", "PDAC", "advanced stage", "symptoms", "novel preclinical model", "patients", "role", "recurrent pancreatic injury", "pancreatitis", "cancer progression", "findings", "recurrent pancreatitis", "global sequencing approaches", "cancer", "laboratory", "cause", "years", "family history", "molecular complexes", "ATF3", "year survival rate", "significant risk factors", "work", "tissue injury", "novel factor", "cellular pathways", "protein", "diagnosis", "majority", "disease", "adverse environmental conditions", "nature", "injury", "high risk", "animal models", "inflammation", "recurrent forms", "conditions", "pancreatic injury"], "terms": ["events", "death", "ATF3 functions", "pancreatitis", "diagnostics", "progression", "link", "therapeutics", "pancreatic cancer", "PDAC", "advanced stage", "symptoms", "novel preclinical model", "patients", "role", "recurrent pancreatic injury", "pancreatitis", "cancer progression", "findings", "recurrent pancreatitis", "global sequencing approaches", "cancer", "laboratory", "cause", "years", "family history", "molecular complexes", "ATF3", "year survival rate", "significant risk factors", "work", "tissue injury", "novel factor", "cellular pathways", "protein", "diagnosis", "majority", "disease", "adverse environmental conditions", "nature", "injury", "high risk", "animal models", "inflammation", "recurrent forms", "conditions", "pancreatic injury"], "funding_chf": 56126.0, "title_language": "en", "research_org_cities": [{"id": 6058560, "name": "London"}], "original_title": "Defining the role for ATF3 in recurrent pancreatic injury and PDAC", "end_date": "2024-09-30", "researcher_details": [{"role": "PI", "last_name": "Pin", "id": null, "first_name": "Christopher", "middle_name": "Louis"}], "investigator_details": [{"role": "PI", "last_name": "Pin", "id": null, "first_name":
